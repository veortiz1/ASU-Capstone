## Project Description
**Airport Mapping Maintenance Automation**
The project aims to develop an automated chart comparison system to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of an existing PDF Comparison Utility. The current chart comparison process is time-consuming and requires supervision, leading to potential errors and inefficiencies. The proposed solution involves leveraging AI techniques to automate and optimize the chart comparison process and reporting, reducing manual effort and improving overall chart management.
